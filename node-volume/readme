in this project i created and mounted a volume to my node app
in docker containers if container are stoped or remote the data of container is also lost so we need to save that data in our system we 
can achieve this by docker volumes in docker volumes there are mainly three type of volumes 
===> anonymous volume = it is fully managed by docker and also we dont give path to this volume
===> named volume = we give name to this volumes by the data in the container is stored only we can not give anything from utside the conatiner
===> bind mounts = this is the volume mounted by your system(path given by you) to the container

to achieve the concept of volume you can simply run this command after docker build
===> docker build . -t node-app
===> docker run -d -p 3000:80 --name node-app -v feedback:/app/feedback -v "(path of the volume created):/app" -v /app/node-module node:app
 -v is the flag for creating a volume the first volume we created for our feedback and second one is the all data and code storing for working directory in container.
  third one is the anonymous volume for running our dependencies 



====>   SECOND WAY OF CREATING A VOLUME
   we need to specify a folder in our system to where our container data is stored by the use of mkdir command
then run the following command 
===> docker volume create --name node-app-volume --opt type=none --opt device=(path of the directory) --opt o=bind
by above comand our volume get created then we to mount to the conatiner by following command
===> docker run -p 3000:80 --mount source=node-app-volume,target=/app node-app:latest
